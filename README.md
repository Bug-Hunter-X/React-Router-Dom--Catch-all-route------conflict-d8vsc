This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Router Dom v6 where a catch-all route ('/*') interferes with other routes if it's not placed at the end of the route definitions within the Routes component. The bug.js file shows the problematic code, while bugSolution.js provides the corrected version.  The problem arises because the catch-all route matches any path, overriding specific routes defined earlier.  The solution involves rearranging the routes so that the catch-all route is the last one processed.
